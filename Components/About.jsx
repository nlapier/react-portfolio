				<h1 className="text-center">About Me</h1>

				<p>
					Born and raised in Austin, TX, I studied economics at Trinity University before moving to New York City in 2010.   I am currently studying full stack web development at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp,  with the goal of working as a junior developer when I graduate in October.  I pay my bills working as a handyman on Taskrabbit, and a courier on UberRUSH. When I&#8217;m not coding or working, I like to explore, travel, volunteer, ride my bicycle and motorcycle, and plot to import breakfast tacos and the word &#34;y&#8217;all&#34; to NYC.

				<p>
					In addition to HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, I can hold my own using:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>jQuery</li>
					<li>Node.js</li>
					<li>Express.js</li>
					<li>Firebase</li>
					<li>MySQL</li>
					<li>MongoDB</li>
					<li>React.js</li>
				</ul>
				
			</div>
